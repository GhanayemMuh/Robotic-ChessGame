# Interactive Chess with XArm Lite6
Dive into the future of board games with our cutting-edge project: an interactive chess game where you match wits against a robotic arm. Developed for the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and leveraging the power of Python, this project brings the classic game of chess into the realm of robotics and computer vision. Utilizing the precision of the Realsense D435 camera for image processing, we've created a system that not only recognizes each piece on the chessboard but also calculates their positions relative to the XArm lite6 robotic arm. Integrated with an advanced chess engine, the robotic arm contemplates and executes moves with strategic prowess, offering players of all levels a challenging and educational experience.

# Getting Started
To immerse yourself in this interactive chess experience, you'll need:

A black and white chessboard
3D printed chess pieces, designed for easy manipulation by the vacuum gripper
A depth-capable camera (like the Realsense D435)
Yellow and green tape to outline the Region Of Interest (ROI) on your chessboard, ensuring precise detection and isolation of the chessboard from the surrounding environment
Setup
Surround your chessboard with yellow and green tape to define the ROI.
Ensure your 3D printed chess pieces are placed on the board.
Connect your depth-capable camera and position it to have a clear view of the chessboard.
Run the provided Python script to start the game.
